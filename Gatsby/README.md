# Integrate SAWO in a Gatsby Site

## What is Gatsby?
* Gatsby is an ***open source framework*** that helps you to develop static webpages and apps with React.
* Gatsby sites are incredibly fast to build and are equally quick in performance.

# Software Requirements
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14.15 or newer) 
  * [Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)
  * Gatsby command line interface (CLI) (v3 or newer)
  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads)

*Check the detailed Guide [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/)*


## Why use Gatsby?
* If you love plugins, then you definitely will love their impressive collection of plugins.
* Build a Progressive Web App.


# Get Started
Let's start by:
## 0. Creating a Gatsby site
Create your first Gatsby site taking reference from the official [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/) of Gatsby.

## 1. Generate a SAWO API key
   - Create / Register for an account with SAWO [here!](https://dev.sawolabs.com/) for passwordless authentication.
   - If you already have one, then navigate to **[SAWO Dashboard](https://dev.sawolabs.com/dash/dashboard)**.
   - On your SAWO dashboard, click on **Create New Project** button at the bottom left to create your new project.

</p>

   - Choose **Web** ðŸ’» (as your building a webpage)

</p>

   - Choose your setup mode based on your preference.

 ## Code : For creating your custom web-app using *Gatsby*.

</p>

   - Click **Continue**.

   - Provide a name for your project that you intend to integrate it with. (Here's mine: ```myGatsby_Site```)

</p>

  ## Host Name

| Property | Solution |
|-|-|
| `Not Deployed` | Your default **LOCAL HOSTNAME** itself will be your hostname: "**127.0.0.1**" ðŸ˜Ž|
| `Deployed/Hosted` | Enter the **DOMAIN NAME** without the preceeding or trailing special symbols like the ```/``` or ```www```, ```http://```, ```https://```, ```ftp://```, and so on.|

  **Example:** https://dev.sawolabs.com/ should be kept as **dev.sawolabs.com**

- Finally, click the **CREATE** button! By default, you API Keys created using SAWO are downloaded as a `csv` file. Securely save them.


<h1 align="center"> Wohoo!!ðŸŽŠ You successfully set you an API Key for yourself. </h1>

## 2. Integrate SAWO in Gatsby


**Check your Parent Directory**: It must be *Gatsby site directory*.


- **Install SAWO SDK**(Package): Within your code terminal, before you integrate SAWO API in your project.

  ```shell
  npm i sawo
  ```


- **Import SAWO SDK**: After installation, create a new *JavaScript* file, for keeping your ***SAWO Login*** UI data in one place.

  ```js
  import Sawo from 'sawo'
  ```


- **Import Classes**: You can create a login page using below code. Import these classes:

  ```js
  import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
  import Sawo from 'sawo'
  import { navigate } from 'gatsby'
  ```


- **Style the JavaScript Sheet**: Style in the same "Login - JavaScript file". Copy contents from the ```index.js``` boilerplate.


#### Keep just this section within the boilerplate:
  ```js
   // Styles
   const pageStyles = {
     color: '#bf7ed6',
     padding: 80,
     fontFamily: 'Roboto, sans-serif, serif',
   }
   const headingStyles = {
     marginTop: 10,
     marginBottom: 45,
     maxWidth: 400,
   }
   // markup
   const IndexPage = () => {
     useEffect(() => {
       var config = {
         // should be same as the id of the container created on 3rd step
         containerID: 'CONTAINER_ID_HERE',
         // can be one of 'email' or 'phone_number_sms'
         identifierType: 'email',
         // Add the API key copied from 5th step
         apiKey: 'API_KEY_HERE',
         // Add a callback here to handle the payload sent by sdk
         onSuccess: (payload) => {
         // you can use this payload for your purpose
           navigate('/TO_PAGE_HERE')
         },
       }
       let sawo = new Sawo(config)
       sawo.showForm()
     }, [])
     return (
       <main style={pageStyles}>
         <title> Login Page </title>
          <h1 style={headingStyles}>Login Page</h1>
          <div id="sawo-container" style={{ height: '300px', width: '400px' }}> </div>
       </main>
     )
   }
   export default IndexPage
  ```

</p>


| Placeholders | Solutions |
|-|-|
| `CONTAINER_ID_HERE` | Enter the "Project ID" mentioned on your SAWO Dashboard. Refer the image for reference (Yellow)|
| `API_KEY_HERE` | Enter the "API Key" mentioned on your SAWO Dashboard. Refer the image for reference (Green)|
| `/TO_PAGE_HERE` | Linking your index.js and the Login Page (with the directory path)|
