# Integrate SAWO in a Next.js Webpage

## What is Next.js?
* Next.js is an **Open-Source Development Framework** for building Server-side and Client-side rendered React applications, so that users can view and interact with.

* It performs 2 kinds of Pre-Rendering, that support on a per-page basis:

     1. Static-Site Generation (<b>SSG</b>),

     2. Server-Side rendering (<b>SSR</b>)

* It also performs **API Routing** that helps to access data present within the databases.

* Next.js acts as a complete full-stack framework, which is built on top of React.


# Software Requirements
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14.15 or newer)
  * Operating System: MacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux.
  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads)

*Check the detailed Guide [here](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup)*


## Why use Next.js?
* It is a simple **Static Site Generators**
* It renders JavaScript in the browser itself
* The client-side application has full interactivity with the content, despite it effectively being just a copy-paste content.
* Cross-Platform
* Short Loading Times
* Supports TypeScript
* **Zero Configuration**: The Pages & Applications are automatically compiled, and bundled.


# Get Started
Let's start by:
## 0. Creating a Next.js Webpage
After all your installations; You will have something like this on the left of your code-area *[VSCode Explorer]*.

## 1. Generate a SAWO API key
   - Create / Register for an account with SAWO [here!](https://dev.sawolabs.com/) for passwordless authentication.
   - If you already have one, then navigate to **[SAWO Dashboard](https://dev.sawolabs.com/dash/dashboard)**.
   - On your SAWO dashboard, click on **Create New Project** button at the bottom left to create your new project.

 </p>

   - Click **Continue**.

   - Provide a name for your project that you intend to integrate it with. (Here's mine: ```SAWO_Login```)

</p>

  ## Host Name

| Property | Solution |
|-|-|
| `Not Deployed` | Your default **LOCAL HOSTNAME** itself will be your hostname: "**127.0.0.1**" ðŸ˜Ž|
| `Deployed/Hosted` | Enter the **DOMAIN NAME** without the preceeding or trailing special symbols like the ```/``` or ```www```, ```http://```, ```https://```, ```ftp://```, and so on.|

  **Example:** https://dev.sawolabs.com/ should be kept as **dev.sawolabs.com**

- Finally, click the **CREATE** button!
- By default, you API Keys created using SAWO are downloaded as a `csv` file. Securely, save them.


<h1 align="center"> Wohoo!!ðŸŽŠ You successfully generated an API Key for yourself! </h1>

## 2. Integrate SAWO within Next.js

- Assuming, you have created a new <b>Project</b> during your instalation process, that same <b>Project name must be remembered</b>.



- **Follow this path**: <br />

{ Your Project name } â–¶ Pages â–¶ index.js [If, you are working using JavaScript]



- **Install SAWO-React SDK**(Package): Within your code terminal, before you integrate SAWO API in your project.

  ```shell
  npm i sawo-react
  ```


- Create a new *JavaScript* file, for keeping all your ***SAWO Login*** UI data in one place.


- **Import SawoLogin - SDK for React**: Import this class:

  ```js
  import SawoLogin from "sawo-react"
  ```


- **Import Classes**: Import these classes:

  ```js
  import React, { useEffect } from "react";
  import SawoLogin from "sawo-react";
  ```


- **Style the JavaScript Sheet**:
     1. Style in the same "Login - JavaScript file".
     2. Copy contents from the ```index.js``` boilerplate.
     3. Feel free to change the *style properties*, according to your convinience.
     4. You can create a login page using below code.


#### Copy and paste this code:
  ```js
    import React, { useEffect } from "react";
    import SawoLogin from "sawo-react";
     const [PAGE_NAME] = () => {
          function sawoLoginCallback(payload) {
     console.log(payload);
           }
      const sawoConfig = {
         onSuccess: sawoLoginCallback, //required,
         identifierType: "phone_number_sms", //required, must be one of: 'email', 'phone_number_sms',
         apiKey: "API_KEY_HERE", // required, get it from sawo dev.sawolabs.com,
         containerHeight: "300px", // the login container height, default is 300px
      };
      return (
      <div>
         <SawoLogin config={sawoConfig} />
      </div>
      );
      };
      
      export default [PAGE_NAME];
   ```


| Placeholders | Solutions |
|-|-|
| `API_KEY_HERE` | Enter the "API Key" mentioned on your SAWO Dashboard|
| `PAGE_NAME` | Enter the JavaScript file name in Camelcase (Abc)|


- **Update your index.js**:


  ```js
  import { useEffect } from 'react'
  export default function Home() {
    return (
        <div>
          <h1 align="center" width= {50} height= {50}> Hello! Welcome to your NextJS Dashboard! </h1>
        </div>
    )
  }
  ```
